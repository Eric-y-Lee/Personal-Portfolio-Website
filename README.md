# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website that I have built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website includes a brief introduction about me, contact information, and a list of my projects. There is a navigation bar at the top of the website that when clicked, is scrolled to the correct tab. The website is also adjusted to the correct screen size.
