# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, which I built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website includes a brief introduction about me, contact information, and a list of my projects. It is mobile compatible as the screen size changes, and the images and texts also change accordingly. A navigation bar is at the top of the website to allow easy navigation around the website. This website is deployed using Github Pages. The website is updated frequently for better features and recent project changes.
