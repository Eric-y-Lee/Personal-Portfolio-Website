                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, my name is Eric Lee. I am currently a student of University of Arkansas at 
                        Fayetteville and pursing a degree in Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science 
                        and minors in Mathematics and Data Analytics. I am expected to graduate December of 2024.</p>
                    <br>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I took interest in coding 
                        since Highschool and I know languages Java, Python, HTML, JavaScript, and C++.
                        I built this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to 
                        display my skills at coding, personal projects, and more!</p>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;As a computer science student, I built my personal portfolio website from scratch
                            using combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website includes introduction 
                            about myself, contact information, list of projects, and directory to my LinkedIn, 
                            and Github.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;Using HTML, I created the website's structure and content to decide which sections go
                            where, how it should flow within the website, and the text inclduing this one! 
                            With CSS, I added custom styles to the elements ensuring that its appearence is aesthetically
                            pleasing and adpating the layout to different window sizes. 
                            JavaScript is also implemented to enhance user interaction such as adjusting the navigating bar
                            according to the different window size and incorporating popup-window to read details on the 
                            projects I have done.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the development process, I practiced clean coding, ability to problem-solve, and 
                            learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
                        </p>
                        <p class = "hidden" id = "text2">
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;Using Java, I implemented a Link game where the user is able to interact with Link by
                            moving around a map, throwing boomerangs, and detecting collisions with walls and pots. 
                            This is an in-class project that was accomplished by applying
                            object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;The Link walking animation is achieved by looping through a series of images, 
                            depending on the direction of walking. Additionally, Link can throw a boomerang by pressing 
                            'CONTROL'. The boomerang image also changes, depending on the direction it is thrown.
                            When Link collides with a pot, the pot is pushed in the same direction until it collides against 
                            a wall. Once collided, the pot changes to a broken image and remains on the screen for a couple 
                            of seconds before disappearing. The same behavior applies when a boomerang collides with a pot.
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, a Sprite class was created using abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, 
                            acting as a superclass. Subclasses, such as Link class, Pot class, Tile class, and Boomerang class, were 
                            created to reduce the complexity of the code and avoid adding unnecessary methods to the classes. 
                            Inheritance and polymorphism are used, as all the classes listed above are related to each other, 
                            and each method has different uses for each subclass.
